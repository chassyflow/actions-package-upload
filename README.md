# Actions workflow run

This GitHub Action will allow you to upload a package or image to Chassy Index.

## Authentication with Chassy

In addition to any configuration options, you also must have `CHASSY_TOKEN`
defined within the environment. This is a secret value and as such should be
stored within your repository's or organization's GitHub secrets. This value is
what allows Chassy to authorize your workflow execution and prevents strangers
from executing workflows that aren't theirs. It is quite a long string encoded
in base64.

| Variable       | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `CHASSY_TOKEN` | Authentication token for automated workflow execution |

If `CHASSY_TOKEN` isn't defined, the action will fail to execute the workflow.

## Usage in Development

Each of these options can be used in the `with` section when you call this
action.

## Development

Add the package upload action to your workflow by checking it out and then
having the correct input args.

For example, see the following:

```yml
example-pkg-upload:
  name: Example Package Upload
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  env:
    CHASSY_TOKEN: <base64 encoded token>
    CHASSY_ENDPOINT: https://api.test.chassy.dev
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      id: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Chassy package upload
      id: test-action
      uses: chassyflow/actions-package-upload
      with:
        architecture: 'ARM64'
        os: 'ubuntu'
        version: '22.04'
        type: 'IMAGE'
        path: '**/release.img'
        classification: 'RFSIMAGE'
        mode: 'INFO'
```
